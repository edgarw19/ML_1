    85 It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device. 0

    88 I've had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear. 0

    89 I have this phone and it is a thorn in my side, I really abhor it. 0

    98 The pleather case doesn't fit. 0

   112 I have had this phone for over a year now, and I will tell you, its not that great. 0

   122 It defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset. 0

   135 First of all, it doesn't wear well. 0

   136 I wouldn't recommend buying this product. 0

   140 DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE. 0

   154 However-the riingtones are not the best, and neither are the games. 0

   163 Was not happy. 0

   170 Excellent starter wireless headset. 0

   171 The loudspeaker option is great, the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing. 0

   198 Att is not clear, sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk. 0

   201 Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone. 0

   212 Does not fit. 0

   216 Not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses. 0

   232 Its not user friendly. 0

   269 If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn't it. 0

   277 The battery life is highly unacceptable. 0

   294 It doesn't work in Europe or Asia. 0

   300 Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pack. 0

   302 Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point. 0

   303 Very Dissapointing Performance. 0

   315 When I placed my treo into the case, not only was it NOT snug, but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides. 0

   340 The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone. 0

   344 It doesn't make you look cool. 0

   393 Does Not Work. 0

   396 Battery has no life. 0

   398 Doesn't do the job. 0

   400 Not as good as I had hoped. 0

   416 Car charger as well as AC charger are included to make sure you never run out of juice.Highy recommended 1

   450 Will order from them again! 1

   471 It is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it. 1

   506 The "1.2" mega pixel camera, being a part of a phone, is reasonably good7. 1

   513 I would recommend this. 1

   517 I usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight & doesn't mess up my hair. 1

   568 We have gotten a lot of compliments on it. 1

   572 I was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem. 1

   609 Better than you'd expect. 1

   644 We would recommend these to others. 1

   649 The delivery was on time. 1

   654 You won't regret it! 1

   698 This fixes all the problems. 1

   701 It does everything the description said it would. 1

   704 Better than expected. 1

   713 Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing. 1

   718 clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming. 1

   723 All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul. 1

   726 I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed. 1

   744 Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with. 1

   755 Because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all. 1

   780 The design is very good.4. 1

   788 Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.1

   810 Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  0

   816 But it's just not funny.  0

   828 There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  0

   831 And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  0

   847 The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  0

   854 My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  0

   859 All in all, a great disappointment.  0

   860 I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this "film".  0

   894 This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  0

   897 This film has no redeeming features.  0

   899 Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.  0

   908 Highly unrecommended.  0

   913 There were too many close ups.  0

   918 The film is way too long.  0

   920 I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  0

   925 It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  0

   928 There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  0

   945 If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  0

   946 This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  0

   987 It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  0

   991 Didn't laugh or even smile once.  0

   999 The new characters weren't all that memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who.  0

  1041 Not even good for camp value!  0

  1063 The directing is sloppy at best.  0

  1067 And, FINALLY, after all that, we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.  0

  1069 It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.  0

  1099 i wouldnt see this movie again for free.  0

  1117 This convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here.  0

  1122 Not recommended.  0

  1131 Filmiing was less expansive.  0

  1132 It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  0

  1134 Not recommended.  0

  1150 And the accents are absolutely abysmal!  0

  1165 It is not good.  0

  1188 The lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong.  0

  1189 You can find better movies at youtube.  0

  1200 That was done in the second movie.  0

  1215 How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this? 1

  1222 Waste your money on this game.  1

  1223 This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  1

  1228 It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  1

  1234 Totally believable.  1

  1242 The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  1

  1248 If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it.  1

  1251 Give this one a look.  1

  1262 I don't think you will be disappointed.  1

  1266 Some applause should be given to the "prelude" however.  1

  1271 I'd advise anyone to go and see it.  1

  1274 I liked this movie way too much.  1

  1278 Still, I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one.  1

  1324 Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  1

  1330 I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.  1

  1348 I will never forget it now.  1

  1364 Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  1

  1375 They could be used as exemplars for any set designer.  1

  1384 Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.  1

  1406 The soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.  1

  1407 Still, it was the SETS that got a big "10" on my "oy-vey" scale.  1

  1409 The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.  1

  1419 This movie was kind of long in length, but I enjoyed every minute of it.  1

  1420 Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale.  1

  1421 Lifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.  1

  1424 But this movie really got to me.  1

  1425 See it.  1

  1462 Go watch it!  1

  1497 Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  1

  1507 All of the main players are mesmerising.  1

  1509 Julian Fellowes has triumphed again.  1

  1511 GO AND SEE IT!  1

  1515 The film gives meaning to the phrase, "Never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.  1

  1524 I advise you to look out for it.  1

  1525 You wont regret it!  1

  1543 Despite the pans of reviewers, I liked this movie.  1

  1547 I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable.  1

  1548 But I thought his acting was skilled.  1

  1555 A standout scene.  1

  1569 You won't forget this movie!  1

  1575 If you want a real scare rent this one!  1

  1582 Predictable, but not a bad watch.  1

  1601 Crust is not good. 0

  1602 Not tasty and the texture was just nasty. 0

  1604 Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.) 0

  1612 did not like at all. 0

  1634 The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well. 0

  1646 It was not good. 0

  1650 I've had better atmosphere. 0

  1660 He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas. 0

  1662 The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us. 0

  1674 So don't go there if you are looking for good food... 0

  1678 The service here leaves a lot to be desired. 0

  1689 The warm beer didn't help. 0

  1692 Must have been an off night at this place. 0

  1697 Which are small and not worth the price. 0

  1716 Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too. 0

  1727 This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant. 0

  1750 The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons. 0

  1760 Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas. 0

  1789 We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them. 0

  1815 The selection of food was not the best. 0

  1822 Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca. 0

  1828 A greasy, unhealthy meal. 0

  1831 And it was way to expensive. 0

  1842 I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!0

  1861 The kids play area is NASTY! 0

  1863 It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor. 0

  1870 I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed. 0

  1910 I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak. 0

  1920 Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting. 0

  1925 When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way. 0

  1936 the food is not tasty at all, not to say its "real traditional Hunan style". 0

  1943 The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily. 0

  1949 I'm super pissd. 0

  1953 The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place! 0

  1966 The service here is fair at best. 0

  1967 I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services. 0

  1977 This place deserves no stars. 0

  1990 Weird vibe from owners. 0

  1993 Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless. 0

  2007 I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken,with cranberry...mmmm! 1

  2028 He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table. 1

  2035 We'd definitely go back here again. 1

  2041 The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected. 1

  2048 Omelets are to die for! 1

  2052 Will be back again! 1

  2056 The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming. 1

  2090 I was seated immediately. 1

  2092 Restaurant is always full but never a wait. 1

  2098 Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers! 1

  2120 Extremely Tasty! 1

  2123 - the food is rich so order accordingly. 1

  2135 Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas. 1

  2142 They know how to make them here. 1

  2151 You cant go wrong with any of the food here. 1

  2157 I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed. 1

  2174 And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong. 1

  2176 Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews. 1

  2180 You won't be disappointed. 1

  2204 Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas. 1

  2206 He deserves 5 stars. 1

  2225 Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible. 1

  2226 I'll definitely be in soon again. 1

  2231 I can assure you that you won't be disappointed. 1

  2236 No complaints! 1

  2252 Food was so gooodd. 1

  2274 I will be back many times soon. 1

  2293 Point your finger at any item on the menu, order it and you won't be disappointed1

  2295 If you haven't gone here GO NOW! 1

  2297 Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for. 1

  2298 This was my first time and I can't wait until the next. 1

  2301 This place is two thumbs up....way up. 1

  2310 Last night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back1

  2311 My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service. 1

  2314 I would recommend saving room for this! 1

  2342 We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed! 1

  2352 High-quality chicken on the chicken Caesar salad. 1

  2367 Very convenient, since we were staying at the MGM! 1

  2375 I promise they won't disappoint. 1

  2379 I can't wait to go back. 1

  2381 I gave it 5 stars then, and I'm giving it 5 stars now. 1

  2397 Service is quick and even "to go" orders are just like we like it! 1

  2399 2 Thumbs Up!! 1
